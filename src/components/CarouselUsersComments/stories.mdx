# CarouselUsersComments

This is a carousel component for rendering image comments from social media users.

## Default

This component can receive data from an api and render an on-screen carousel with comment cards from social media followers.

The carousel has control by scroll arrows, navigation bulets and also by focus event in case of mouseless navigation.

On devices with screens greater than or equal to 768px, two cards are displayed per row in the carousel, on lower resolutions only one card per row is displayed.

To wait for data coming from an api a load is shown until everything can be loaded.
